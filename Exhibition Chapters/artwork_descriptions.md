# Chapter1
## The Replicated Self

Selfhood is not self-made, but shaped in subtle repetitions, negotiated glances, and
quiet adjustments to what is expected.
 
In the process of fitting in, we often leave parts of ourselves behind—
Not suddenly, but gradually, until something once alive becomes quiet, then disappears.

## 1.1  Mirror

Digital Interactive Art
2017

"Mirror” is an interactive artwork that employs a random dithering algorithm to compress and reproduce the form of the spectator standing before the screen. Continuously generated and reactive to its environment, the work utilises the fluid and malleable nature of digital devices to create an immersive space for which the image has no static or final form. By reducing the viewer into a sea of binary pixels, "Mirror" explores the increasingly blurred boundary between the physical and virtual realms, pondering the relationship between people and digital machines, and raising the question of what happens to our physical presence when digital spaces become more intoxicating than real ones.

## Sharleen Cu

Sharleen Cu is a multidisciplinary artist with a background in illustration. Her works play with the art of self-portraiture through mixed media in order to explore the complicated mess that makes up her identity as a Chinese-Filipino living in Australia. She aims to depict a multiverse of characters, with quirks and colours that reflect her childlike, inner world.

Despite their apparent differences and personal narrative, her works are united by themes of destiny, spirituality, and dualism. Sharleen aims to remind the viewer that “oneself” is not truly any “one” at all, but a part of something much more limitless.

The work tells the story of how the individual gradually takes shape within the interplay of relationships and environment. It reveals the deeper narrative hidden beneath the surface—a journey of growth, woven from emotions, memories, and the threads of time and space, tracing who we are and how we came to be.





# Chapter2
## The Rewilded Senses

Even in the default disciplinary reality, feelings still find their way to nurturing the part
of us that continues to listen beneath it all. 
 
Our bodily senses are quietly awakening— through the scent in the air, the taste of dampness, the textures beneath our fingertips, the soft glimmers of light, and the quiet sounds of nature—reigniting memories the body has never truly forgotten.

bohemian_rhapsody.png

## 2.1  Bohemian Rhapsody

Color, Video, Digital Art 
2025

This is an experimental video composed of dot matrix colors. At first glance, the visuals may seem chaotic, even a bit psychedelic, but they actually conceal hidden 3D imagery. It uses a technique called “autostereogram” (or hidden stereogram)—by using the “parallel eye” method (relaxing your eyes and looking through the image), figures in three dimensions gradually emerge from the seemingly random dots.

The inspiration came from Canadian artist Jared Raab’s work Black is Good, a hidden stereoscopic music video created using an Xbox 360 depth-sensing camera and custom code. The result is visually striking, and I wanted to try something similar—both as a vision training tool and a moving image experiment.

Due to technical limitations, the foreground is still made up of randomly generated colored dot matrices through code. But that unpredictability is part of what makes the work interesting—it becomes an experiment about seeing itself.


Note: When viewing this work, relax your eyes, let them go out of focus, and empty your mind — only then can you discover the hidden mysteries within.

## 2.7  Null’s Lamp

Metal, acrylic
45 × 15 × 15 cm
2025

Through the skillful use of reflective color, this work not only creates a rich spatial atmosphere but also effectively guides human behavior and visual flow. Light and color, as key elements in spatial design, have a profound impact on perception and emotional experience. The precise application of reflective color allows the space to present diverse visual effects under varying lighting conditions, enhancing both its appeal and functionality.

Null’s Lamp is guided by the core concept of “light-color fusion,” and its brand design is built upon the principles of color reflection. It stands apart from traditional lighting, which typically relies on fixed point sources. Inspired by the idea of a “log of cyclical light changes,” the lamp utilizes movable panels, reflective surfaces of different materials, adjustable angles, textures, and light transmittance to control the interplay of light and color. This results in a distinctive luminous atmosphere where color diffuses through reflection, giving the spatial design a dynamic and vibrant visual experience.

Note: You are welcome to interact with the installation — all movable parts can be freely adjusted.

The microscopic structure of a butterfly’s wings allows us, at close range, to glimpse a microcosm revealed in entirely different forms.

Under a microscopic lens, the scales on the wing’s surface resemble meticulously arranged mosaics, refracting subtle shifts of light and colour, and opening up a whole new way of seeing.

When I strolled through the neighborhood, I carried a ball of hemp yarn in my pocket, tying knots one by one to form a stronger, thicker rope. In ancient Inca and Chinese cultures, before written language was invented, humans tied knots in pieces of rope to record important historical events and stories or to spread information. For me, tying knots is a reminder to take things one step at a time and not to rush.

Modern society often prides itself on busyness, as if we’re always hurrying toward the next task or destination. The Chinese word for "busy" (忙 máng) combines two characters: 亡 (meaning "to perish") and 心 (meaning "heart"), symbolizing a "dying heart." By observing and recreating ancient Chinese clay pots using rice and natural fibers, I reconnect with history and Chineses heritage. It reminds me how far humanity has come, and that it’s okay to slow down and move at my own pace.

Each city has its own story to tell. I especially love exploring urban spaces by observing the textures of walls. While strolling aimlessly through my hometown, Chaozhou, China, I stumbled upon a wall made of large ceramic pots with rich, earthy hues. My hometown is known for its ceramic factories and large pots have long been mass-produced for storing and preserving food. Instead of throwing away the imperfect ones, locals repurposed them, and built the pots into new house walls. We use what we've got and it's about saving money and maximising resources.

Inspired by the Great Wall of China’s construction, where sticky rice was mixed into the mortar to strengthen the structure, I joined leftover 'bricks' and 'pots' from previous projects, binding them with rice and grass to form a new wall and new story.

rain.png

## 2.10  Rain: The Apparent Threshold

Deconstructed umbrella frame, nylon filament,  glass, UV - cured
105cmx 90cm
2025 

This work reimagines the umbrella as a skeletal structure, stripping away its protective canopy to reveal the inner frame. Nylon filaments intertwine with suspended transparent elements, capturing the instant a raindrop lands through UV-cured resin.

An umbrella creates a semi-private space that separates you from the world, offering a sense of psychological safety while allowing you to observe the outside through sight and sound. A transparent umbrella blurs this boundary — the more visual openness it provides, the more sensory stimuli reach the person beneath it. This heightened openness deepens one’s experience of the world, awakening sensitivity to details that might otherwise be overlooked.

The piece explores both the physical boundary of the umbrella and the psychological threshold it creates, using tangible materials to approach the intangible nature of rain. By removing the conventional surface, it suspends the fleeting moment when rain becomes visible, blurring the line between shelter and exposure. 


## 2.11 Water Droplet Series

The city is built of inorganic structures, cold and orderly. I use lightweight, rust-free aluminum with a cool sheen to symbolize urban functionality. When raindrops fall onto metal, their irregular shapes blur the line between nature and the city, adding a new layer to its geometry. The work captures the instant of rain hitting metal, with droplets suspended on transparent threads, freezing their motion and light.

This work captures the quiet aftermath of rainfall, when droplets remain on a metal surface. Lightweight, rust-free aluminum symbolizes the urban environment, while the UV resin and vegetable oil recreate the texture and clarity of real water. The suspended droplets evoke a sense of stillness, preserving the fleeting beauty of rain before it disappears.

This ring incorporates elements of light, shadow, and trees. The wooden base is layered with movable, rotatable leaves, with real leaf fragments embedded to simulate the dappled shadows seen under sunlight. Above, a water droplet evokes the atmosphere of a sunshower — golden light glistens on the leaves before being suddenly darkened by rain. In the fleeting moment after the rainfall, droplets cling to the leaves, sparkling once more under the returning sunlight.

Drops Between Fingers marks the beginning of the Water Droplet Series, capturing the sensation of water droplets slipping between fingers and rippling outward, symbolizing the flow of life. The work began with research into various transparent materials to explore ways of representing the form of water. While water itself has no inherent color, it reflects and contains the hues of its surroundings. The droplets on the ring shift dynamically with the wearer’s hand movements, offering a tactile and visual experience of water flowing between the fingers.

shiyin.png

## Shiyin Li

The artist is 27 years old and has been painting for 16 years. Since childhood, art has been a constant part of her life. Driven by a deep love for creativity, she continues to paint with instinct and persistence. Over time, she developed a habit of "thinking while painting," creating each work with intuitive, spontaneous strokes.

She works in various styles and is especially skilled in abstract line drawing, watercolor, digital painting, and pencil sketching. Rather than traditional realism, her art focuses on expressing inner emotions through line, color, and composition. Her abstract works explore intuition and feeling, free from the limits of physical reality or logic.

She often visualizes flowing images in her mind, like fast-changing film scenes, which inspire her work. She has never experienced creative block and easily moves between abstract and figurative styles.

Through years of practice, she has developed her own visual language—where lines express emotion, color follows intuition, and every piece becomes a direct conversation between artist and medium.

## 2.17  Bird of Paradise

It was the 188th day of the war. Smoke covered the broken town. Suddenly, a child shouted, “The Bird of Paradise is here!”
Other children peeked out from behind the ruins, eyes wide with wonder. “The Bird of Paradise is here!” they repeated.
The magical bird had arrived. Its colorful wings glowed like jewels. Elders once said: if the bird's wings touch you, you’ll grow white feathers and fly with it to a peaceful paradise.
The children watched in awe. The glowing wings gently touched a few of them—then, soft white wings appeared on their backs!
The bird’s light grew brighter, and its wings changed shape, forming a glowing time-travel ship. A calm voice spoke in their minds: “Portal ready. Destination: a new peaceful home. Come aboard.”

The chosen children slowly floated into the air, carried by an invisible force. They entered the ship, smiling with joy and excitement.

The ship vanished silently, leaving behind only a swirl of colored light that quickly disappeared.

The square became quiet again. The children who stayed behind still looked up at the sky. The wind blew dust through the ruins. They stood like forgotten seeds, waiting.

Was that door a rescue—or another goodbye? No one knew. The world kept turning. And the waiting continued.
