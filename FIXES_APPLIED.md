# Fixes Applied to Sensitive Beings Website

## âœ… 1. Wave Visualization - Natural Radio Waves

**Problem**: Original wave pattern was too linear and geometric
**Solution**: 
- Created **concentric radio wave circles** emanating from center
- Added **horizontal flowing wave patterns** for natural movement  
- Implemented **pulse-based animations** that simulate radio wave propagation
- Enhanced **mouse interaction** with ripple effects specific to radio waves
- Used different wave frequencies and amplitudes for realistic radio wave behavior

**Files Updated**: `scripts/waves.js`

## âœ… 2. Artist Gallery Navigation Fixed

**Problem**: Carousel navigation buttons and swipe gestures not working
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive **debugging logging** to track initialization and events
- Fixed **event binding** issues with proper error handling
- Improved **slide positioning logic** with absolute positioning
- Enhanced **touch gesture detection** with better threshold handling  
- Fixed **chapter filtering** to maintain proper slide count and positioning
- Added **keyboard navigation** support (Arrow keys)

**Files Updated**: `scripts/gallery-carousel.js`

## âœ… 3. Workshop Timeline Navigation Fixed  

**Problem**: Workshop timeline carousel not responding to navigation
**Solution**:
- Added **initialization debugging** to verify element detection
- Fixed **button event listeners** with proper preventDefault handling
- Enhanced **touch gesture support** for mobile devices
- Improved **slide transition logic** with better animation timing
- Added **indicator dot navigation** for direct week selection
- Fixed **week counting** and boundary checking

**Files Updated**: `scripts/workshop-carousel.js`

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Radio Wave Visualization Features:
- **Concentric circles**: 8 radio wave rings with varying opacity
- **Flowing patterns**: 6 horizontal wave lines with sine wave motion
- **Interactive ripples**: Mouse movement creates realistic wave disturbances
- **Pulse animation**: Time-based radius modulation simulates radio transmission
- **Smooth rendering**: Uses quadratic curves for natural wave appearance

### Navigation Enhancements:
- **Multi-input support**: Mouse clicks, keyboard arrows, touch swipes
- **Visual feedback**: Button states, hover effects, active indicators  
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when elements missing
- **Performance**: Debounced events and efficient DOM updates
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard focus management

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Improvements

1. **Wave Background**: Now displays beautiful, natural radio wave patterns that pulse and ripple
2. **Gallery Navigation**: Smooth 3D carousel with working prev/next buttons and swipe gestures  
3. **Workshop Timeline**: Intuitive week-by-week navigation with indicators and smooth transitions
4. **Debug Console**: Added logging to help troubleshoot any remaining issues
5. **Mobile Support**: Enhanced touch gesture recognition for all carousel components

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

1. **Radio Waves**: Move mouse over hero section to see ripple effects
2. **Artist Gallery**: Use left/right arrows or click navigation buttons to browse artworks
3. **Workshop Timeline**: Navigate between weeks using timeline controls
4. **Mobile**: Test swipe gestures on touch devices
5. **Console**: Check browser developer tools for debug information

All navigation should now work smoothly with visual feedback and proper transitions!
