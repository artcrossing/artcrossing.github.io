                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <h4>The Replicated Self</h4>
                
                <p>Selfhood is not self-made, but shaped in subtle repetitions, negotiated glances, and quiet adjustments to what is expected.</p>
                <p>In the process of fitting in, we often leave parts of ourselves behind‚Äî<br>Not suddenly, but gradually, until something once alive becomes quiet, then disappears.</p>

                <h4>Chris Bowes</h4>
                <p>Chris Bowes is a multidisciplinary artist based in Naarm (Melbourne) who's practice incorporates photography, video and installation. His work explores the material properties of analogue and digital image making, often finding failures within these systems and pushing them to the brink. Bowes' work is held by multiple institutions, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Macquarie Bank and the Muswellbrook Regional Art Centre.</p>

                <h4>1.1 Mirror</h4>
                <p class="artwork-medium">Digital Interactive Art<br>2017</p>
                <p>"Mirror" is an interactive artwork that employs a random dithering algorithm to compress and reproduce the form of the spectator standing before the screen. Continuously generated and reactive to its environment, the work utilises the fluid and malleable nature of digital devices to create an immersive space for which the image has no static or final form. By reducing the viewer into a sea of binary pixels, "Mirror" explores the increasingly blurred boundary between the physical and virtual realms, pondering the relationship between people and digital machines, and raising the question of what happens to our physical presence when digital spaces become more intoxicating than real ones.</p>

                <h4>Jun Wu</h4>
                <p>He is a Chinese artist whose upbringing and education have shaped a sensitive and reflective approach to art-making. He studied in the Oil Painting Department at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, where he developed a foundation in traditional techniques while expanding his practice into contemporary forms.</p>
                <p>Wu's work focuses on everyday sensory experiences and the subtle complexity of the natural world. Using screen printing techniques, he transfers reflections on daily life onto paper, questioning the repetitiveness embedded in routine. The repeated layering of images mirrors the mechanical rhythm of modern life and invites viewers to reconsider their habitual behaviors.</p>
                <p>His works have been featured in numerous solo and group exhibitions across Europe, Asia, Australia, and the United States, gaining recognition for their poetic and process-driven nature.</p>

                <h4>Haojun Yang</h4>
                <p>In 2023, he began his studies at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and in 2025, he will continue his advanced training in the Fourth Printmaking Studio.</p>
                <p>He enjoys wandering alone through the wilderness on the outskirts of the city; the quietude of nature serves as the wellspring of his creativity.</p>
                <p>During his time at the High School Affiliated with the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 2019, five years of living in Yanjiao shaped his sensitivity to the subtle details in nature. The decaying plants along the Chaobai River became the most significant subjects in his creative process, through which he seeks to express the spirituality and timelessness of life.</p>

                <h4>Sharleen Cu</h4>
                <p>Sharleen Cu is a multidisciplinary artist with a background in illustration. Her works play with the art of self-portraiture through mixed media in order to explore the complicated mess that makes up her identity as a Chinese-Filipino living in Australia. She aims to depict a multiverse of characters, with quirks and colours that reflect her childlike, inner world.</p>
                <p>Despite their apparent differences and personal narrative, her works are united by themes of destiny, spirituality, and dualism. Sharleen aims to remind the viewer that "oneself" is not truly any "one" at all, but a part of something much more limitless.</p>

                <p class="artwork-medium">Acrylic, color pencil, wood and Wire<br>2025</p>
                <p>The work tells the story of how the individual gradually takes shape within the interplay of relationships and environment. It reveals the deeper narrative hidden beneath the surface‚Äîa journey of growth, woven from emotions, memories, and the threads of time and space, tracing who we are and how we came to be.</p>
                
                <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
                <h4>The Rewilded Senses</h4>
                
                <p>Even in the default disciplinary reality, feelings still find their way to nurturing the part of us that continues to listen beneath it all.</p>
                <p>Our bodily senses are quietly awakening‚Äî through the scent in the air, the taste of dampness, the textures beneath our fingertips, the soft glimmers of light, and the quiet sounds of nature‚Äîreigniting memories the body has never truly forgotten.</p>

                <h4>Jiahong Lang</h4>
                <p class="artist-role">Digital artist and designer</p>
                <p>Lang Jiahong (b. 2000, China) is a Hangzhou-based artist and designer. He graduated from the China Academy of Art (CAA) with a BFA in Art and Technology in 2022 and is now pursuing an MFA in Visual Communication Design there. Focused on installation art and digital interactive media, his practice explores interdisciplinary media fusion, reimagining color and form possibilities by integrating technology and humanities.</p>
                <p>Adopting a "beyond-sketch" studio approach, Lang creates through cyclical perspectives, transforming everyday observations into temporal interventions. His works embed metamorphosis timelines, reflecting his pursuit of capturing dynamic transitions in material, digital, and conceptual domains.</p>
                
                <img src="Exhibition Chapters/Image/bohemian_rhapsody.png" alt="Bohemian Rhapsody" class="artwork-image">
                
                <h4>2.1 Bohemian Rhapsody</h4>
                <p class="artwork-medium">Color, Video, Digital Art<br>2025</p>
                <p>This is an experimental video composed of dot matrix colors. At first glance, the visuals may seem chaotic, even a bit psychedelic, but they actually conceal hidden 3D imagery. It uses a technique called "autostereogram" (or hidden stereogram)‚Äîby using the "parallel eye" method (relaxing your eyes and looking through the image), figures in three dimensions gradually emerge from the seemingly random dots.</p>
                <p>The inspiration came from Canadian artist Jared Raab's work Black is Good, a hidden stereoscopic music video created using an Xbox 360 depth-sensing camera and custom code. The result is visually striking, and I wanted to try something similar‚Äîboth as a vision training tool and a moving image experiment.</p>
                <p>Due to technical limitations, the foreground is still made up of randomly generated colored dot matrices through code. But that unpredictability is part of what makes the work interesting‚Äîit becomes an experiment about seeing itself.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> When viewing this work, relax your eyes, let them go out of focus, and empty your mind ‚Äî only then can you discover the hidden mysteries within.</p>
                
                <img src="Exhibition Chapters/Image/lamp.png" alt="Null's Lamp" class="artwork-image">
                
                <h4>2.7 Null's Lamp</h4>
                <p class="artwork-medium">Metal, acrylic<br>45 √ó 15 √ó 15 cm<br>2025</p>
                <p>Through the skillful use of reflective color, this work not only creates a rich spatial atmosphere but also effectively guides human behavior and visual flow. Light and color, as key elements in spatial design, have a profound impact on perception and emotional experience. The precise application of reflective color allows the space to present diverse visual effects under varying lighting conditions, enhancing both its appeal and functionality.</p>
                <p>Null's Lamp is guided by the core concept of "light-color fusion," and its brand design is built upon the principles of color reflection. It stands apart from traditional lighting, which typically relies on fixed point sources. Inspired by the idea of a "log of cyclical light changes," the lamp utilizes movable panels, reflective surfaces of different materials, adjustable angles, textures, and light transmittance to control the interplay of light and color. This results in a distinctive luminous atmosphere where color diffuses through reflection, giving the spatial design a dynamic and vibrant visual experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> You are welcome to interact with the installation ‚Äî all movable parts can be freely adjusted.</p>

                <p class="artist-role">Photographer</p>
                <p>An untamable and "wild"-spirited extreme photographer, Wang Heng has maintained long-term, in-depth collaborations with media outlets such as CCTV, BBC, and Discovery Channel. He has participated in the filming of numerous documentary films and productions, including Himalayan Ladder, On the Road, Masters in the Forbidden City, Wildest Vacation, and Snow Leopard.</p>
                <p>Since 2020Ôºå he has ventured into insect macro photography. This series of works has since been exhibited at various art institutions, including the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History.</p>

                <p>The microscopic structure of a butterfly's wings allows us, at close range, to glimpse a microcosm revealed in entirely different forms.</p>
                <p>Under a microscopic lens, the scales on the wing's surface resemble meticulously arranged mosaics, refracting subtle shifts of light and colour, and opening up a whole new way of seeing.</p>
