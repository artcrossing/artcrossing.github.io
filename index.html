                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <h4>The Replicated Self</h4>
                
                <p>Selfhood is not self-made, but shaped in subtle repetitions, negotiated glances, and quiet adjustments to what is expected.</p>
                <p>In the process of fitting in, we often leave parts of ourselves behind‚Äî<br>Not suddenly, but gradually, until something once alive becomes quiet, then disappears.</p>

                <h4>Chris Bowes</h4>
                <p>Chris Bowes is a multidisciplinary artist based in Naarm (Melbourne) who's practice incorporates photography, video and installation. His work explores the material properties of analogue and digital image making, often finding failures within these systems and pushing them to the brink. Bowes' work is held by multiple institutions, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Macquarie Bank and the Muswellbrook Regional Art Centre.</p>
                
                <img src="Exhibition Chapters/Image/mirror.png" alt="Mirror artwork" class="artwork-image">
                
                <h4>1.1 Mirror</h4>
                <p class="artwork-medium">Digital Interactive Art<br>2017</p>
                <p>"Mirror" is an interactive artwork that employs a random dithering algorithm to compress and reproduce the form of the spectator standing before the screen. Continuously generated and reactive to its environment, the work utilises the fluid and malleable nature of digital devices to create an immersive space for which the image has no static or final form. By reducing the viewer into a sea of binary pixels, "Mirror" explores the increasingly blurred boundary between the physical and virtual realms, pondering the relationship between people and digital machines, and raising the question of what happens to our physical presence when digital spaces become more intoxicating than real ones.</p>

                <h4>Jun Wu</h4>
                <p>He is a Chinese artist whose upbringing and education have shaped a sensitive and reflective approach to art-making. He studied in the Oil Painting Department at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, where he developed a foundation in traditional techniques while expanding his practice into contemporary forms.</p>
                <p>Wu's work focuses on everyday sensory experiences and the subtle complexity of the natural world. Using screen printing techniques, he transfers reflections on daily life onto paper, questioning the repetitiveness embedded in routine. The repeated layering of images mirrors the mechanical rhythm of modern life and invites viewers to reconsider their habitual behaviors.</p>
                <p>His works have been featured in numerous solo and group exhibitions across Europe, Asia, Australia, and the United States, gaining recognition for their poetic and process-driven nature.</p>

                <p>In 2023, he began his studies at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and in 2025, he will continue his advanced training in the Fourth Printmaking Studio.</p>
                <p>He enjoys wandering alone through the wilderness on the outskirts of the city; the quietude of nature serves as the wellspring of his creativity.</p>
                <p>During his time at the High School Affiliated with the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 2019, five years of living in Yanjiao shaped his sensitivity to the subtle details in nature. The decaying plants along the Chaobai River became the most significant subjects in his creative process, through which he seeks to express the spirituality and timelessness of life.</p>

                <h4>Sharleen Cu</h4>
                <p>Sharleen Cu is a multidisciplinary artist with a background in illustration. Her works play with the art of self-portraiture through mixed media in order to explore the complicated mess that makes up her identity as a Chinese-Filipino living in Australia. She aims to depict a multiverse of characters, with quirks and colours that reflect her childlike, inner world.</p>
                <p>Despite their apparent differences and personal narrative, her works are united by themes of destiny, spirituality, and dualism. Sharleen aims to remind the viewer that "oneself" is not truly any "one" at all, but a part of something much more limitless.</p>

                <p class="artwork-medium">Acrylic, color pencil, wood and Wire<br>2025</p>
                <p>The work tells the story of how the individual gradually takes shape within the interplay of relationships and environment. It reveals the deeper narrative hidden beneath the surface‚Äîa journey of growth, woven from emotions, memories, and the threads of time and space, tracing who we are and how we came to be.</p>
                
                <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
                <h4>The Rewilded Senses</h4>
                
                <p>Even in the default disciplinary reality, feelings still find their way to nurturing the part of us that continues to listen beneath it all.</p>
                <p>Our bodily senses are quietly awakening‚Äî through the scent in the air, the taste of dampness, the textures beneath our fingertips, the soft glimmers of light, and the quiet sounds of nature‚Äîreigniting memories the body has never truly forgotten.</p>

                <h4>Jiahong Lang</h4>
                <p class="artist-role">Digital artist and designer</p>
                <p>Lang Jiahong (b. 2000, China) is a Hangzhou-based artist and designer. He graduated from the China Academy of Art (CAA) with a BFA in Art and Technology in 2022 and is now pursuing an MFA in Visual Communication Design there. Focused on installation art and digital interactive media, his practice explores interdisciplinary media fusion, reimagining color and form possibilities by integrating technology and humanities.</p>
                <p>Adopting a "beyond-sketch" studio approach, Lang creates through cyclical perspectives, transforming everyday observations into temporal interventions. His works embed metamorphosis timelines, reflecting his pursuit of capturing dynamic transitions in material, digital, and conceptual domains.</p>
                
                <img src="Exhibition Chapters/Image/bohemian_rhapsody.png" alt="Bohemian Rhapsody" class="artwork-image">
                
                <h4>2.1 Bohemian Rhapsody</h4>
                <p class="artwork-medium">Color, Video, Digital Art<br>2025</p>
                <p>This is an experimental video composed of dot matrix colors. At first glance, the visuals may seem chaotic, even a bit psychedelic, but they actually conceal hidden 3D imagery. It uses a technique called "autostereogram" (or hidden stereogram)‚Äîby using the "parallel eye" method (relaxing your eyes and looking through the image), figures in three dimensions gradually emerge from the seemingly random dots.</p>
                <p>The inspiration came from Canadian artist Jared Raab's work Black is Good, a hidden stereoscopic music video created using an Xbox 360 depth-sensing camera and custom code. The result is visually striking, and I wanted to try something similar‚Äîboth as a vision training tool and a moving image experiment.</p>
                <p>Due to technical limitations, the foreground is still made up of randomly generated colored dot matrices through code. But that unpredictability is part of what makes the work interesting‚Äîit becomes an experiment about seeing itself.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> When viewing this work, relax your eyes, let them go out of focus, and empty your mind ‚Äî only then can you discover the hidden mysteries within.</p>
                
                <img src="Exhibition Chapters/Image/lamp.png" alt="Null's Lamp" class="artwork-image">
                
                <h4>2.7 Null's Lamp</h4>
                <p class="artwork-medium">Metal, acrylic<br>45 √ó 15 √ó 15 cm<br>2025</p>
                <p>Through the skillful use of reflective color, this work not only creates a rich spatial atmosphere but also effectively guides human behavior and visual flow. Light and color, as key elements in spatial design, have a profound impact on perception and emotional experience. The precise application of reflective color allows the space to present diverse visual effects under varying lighting conditions, enhancing both its appeal and functionality.</p>
                <p>Null's Lamp is guided by the core concept of "light-color fusion," and its brand design is built upon the principles of color reflection. It stands apart from traditional lighting, which typically relies on fixed point sources. Inspired by the idea of a "log of cyclical light changes," the lamp utilizes movable panels, reflective surfaces of different materials, adjustable angles, textures, and light transmittance to control the interplay of light and color. This results in a distinctive luminous atmosphere where color diffuses through reflection, giving the spatial design a dynamic and vibrant visual experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> You are welcome to interact with the installation ‚Äî all movable parts can be freely adjusted.</p>

                <p>An untamable and "wild"-spirited extreme photographer, Wang Heng has maintained long-term, in-depth collaborations with media outlets such as CCTV, BBC, and Discovery Channel. He has participated in the filming of numerous documentary films and productions, including Himalayan Ladder, On the Road, Masters in the Forbidden City, Wildest Vacation, and Snow Leopard.</p>
                <p>Since 2020Ôºå he has ventured into insect macro photography. This series of works has since been exhibited at various art institutions, including the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History.</p>

                <p>Under a microscopic lens, the scales on the wing's surface resemble meticulously arranged mosaics, refracting subtle shifts of light and colour, and opening up a whole new way of seeing.</p>

                <p class="artist-role">photographer</p>
                <p>Frank James Meuschke has exhibited painting, photography, and sculpture across the United States including at the Mills Gallery, Boston, Museum of the City of New York, Virginia Commonwealth University Fine Arts Gallery, Portland Museum of Art, Socrates Sculpture Park, and Rosalux Gallery in Minneapolis, MN. He has been artist in residence at MacDowell, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Weir Farm Art Center, Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, and Henry Street Settlement and has been the recipient of a 2018, 2021, and 2022 Minnesota State Creative Support Grants. Frank is currently working out of his studio in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.</p>
                <p>Frank James Meuschke's photographs are an expression of melancholy, memory, nature, and place. They are a synthesis of the pleasure of living on this planet with the grief of change. Each photograph has been made using filters made from common, petroleum-based plastics ‚Äîa process that links emotive experiences to culpability while creating imagery of uncertainty, ephemerality, dissolution and strange beauty.</p>

                <p>The four pieces included in "Sensitive Beings" were made between 2021 and 2024. The large fabric prints were included in Meuschke's 2022 solo exhibition "Don't Go Into The Light," a show that revealed ecologically significant sites at a perceptual threshold ‚Äîwhere nature is neither what we remember nor what we wish it to be. The two paper prints seen here were first created for his 2024 solo exhibition "Aesthetics of Melancholy," where the artist engaged a dialogue between nature, national identity, place and personal experience.</p>

                <p class="artist-role">Sculptor, painter, and designer</p>
                <p>Vivian Qiu is an emerging artist with a background in jewellery and fashion. Her practice combines wearable art and sculpture, exploring themes such as cultural identity, healing, and oracle bone script. She works with natural materials like rice, grass, and soil, using experimental methods to reflect on personal identity and cultural roots.</p>
                <p>Vivian is particularly fascinated by the relationship between art, psychology, and personal transformation. She sees the creative process as a way to respond to life's challenges and emotional shifts, inviting viewers to reflect on themselves and reframe their own narratives through her work.</p>
                <p>Her work has been shown in Australia, Sweden, and the Netherlands, including at Galerie Marzee and RMIT Design Hub Gallery. In 2023, she was a finalist in the Emerging Artist Awards at FortyFiveDownstairs. She has also held school residencies and run workshops with institutions like the National Gallery of Victoria, City of Melbourne, and Immigration Museum.</p>
                <p>Vivian's projects were featured in the Melbourne Fashion Festival and Melbourne Design Week in both 2021 and 2023.</p>

                <p class="artwork-medium">rice, embroidery thread, coffee grounds, grass, herbs, tea, grains, hemp yarns, various sizes<br>Various sizes 6cm x 4cm x 4 cm per object<br>2025</p>
                <p>When I strolled through the neighborhood, I carried a ball of hemp yarn in my pocket, tying knots one by one to form a stronger, thicker rope. In ancient Inca and Chinese cultures, before written language was invented, humans tied knots in pieces of rope to record important historical events and stories or to spread information. For me, tying knots is a reminder to take things one step at a time and not to rush.</p>
                <p>Modern society often prides itself on busyness, as if we're always hurrying toward the next task or destination. The Chinese word for "busy" (Âøô m√°ng) combines two characters: ‰∫° (meaning "to perish") and ÂøÉ (meaning "heart"), symbolizing a "dying heart." By observing and recreating ancient Chinese clay pots using rice and natural fibers, I reconnect with history and Chineses heritage. It reminds me how far humanity has come, and that it's okay to slow down and move at my own pace.</p>

                <p class="artwork-medium">Rice, coffee grounds, grass, tea, sand, metal<br>15cm x 12cm x 5cm<br>2025</p>
                <p>Each city has its own story to tell. I especially love exploring urban spaces by observing the textures of walls. While strolling aimlessly through my hometown, Chaozhou, China, I stumbled upon a wall made of large ceramic pots with rich, earthy hues. My hometown is known for its ceramic factories and large pots have long been mass-produced for storing and preserving food. Instead of throwing away the imperfect ones, locals repurposed them, and built the pots into new house walls. We use what we've got and it's about saving money and maximising resources.</p>
                <p>Inspired by the Great Wall of China's construction, where sticky rice was mixed into the mortar to strengthen the structure, I joined leftover 'bricks' and 'pots' from previous projects, binding them with rice and grass to form a new wall and new story.</p>

                <h4>Qianxun Li</h4>
                <p>is a Chinese artist whose upbringing and education in Vietnam and Australia have shaped her unique perspective on the world. She works primarily with gold and silversmithing techniques, having received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from RMIT University (2022‚Äì2024).</p>
                <p>Her practice focuses on capturing the sensory details of daily life and the intricate, microscopic beauty found in nature. Through the use of diverse materials and delicate craftsmanship, she explores the coexistence of fragility and strength in the natural world.</p>
                <p>Blending narrative with multisensory experience, Li aims to guide viewers toward discovering the hidden beauty of nature embedded in the everyday, fostering a deeper emotional connection with the world around them.</p>
                <p>In her Sensitive Beings series, she combines static installations with interactive elements, encouraging audiences to reconnect with themselves and their environment through visual and tactile engagement. Her recent exhibitions include Fresh! 2025, a group show at Craft Watson Place in Naarm/Melbourne.</p>

                <h4>2.10 Rain: The Apparent Threshold</h4>
                <p class="artwork-medium">Deconstructed umbrella frame, nylon filament, glass, UV - cured<br>105cmx 90cm<br>2025</p>
                <p>This work reimagines the umbrella as a skeletal structure, stripping away its protective canopy to reveal the inner frame. Nylon filaments intertwine with suspended transparent elements, capturing the instant a raindrop lands through UV-cured resin.</p>
                <p>An umbrella creates a semi-private space that separates you from the world, offering a sense of psychological safety while allowing you to observe the outside through sight and sound. A transparent umbrella blurs this boundary ‚Äî the more visual openness it provides, the more sensory stimuli reach the person beneath it. This heightened openness deepens one's experience of the world, awakening sensitivity to details that might otherwise be overlooked.</p>
                <p>The piece explores both the physical boundary of the umbrella and the psychological threshold it creates, using tangible materials to approach the intangible nature of rain. By removing the conventional surface, it suspends the fleeting moment when rain becomes visible, blurring the line between shelter and exposure.</p>

                <p>The city is built of inorganic structures, cold and orderly. I use lightweight, rust-free aluminum with a cool sheen to symbolize urban functionality. When raindrops fall onto metal, their irregular shapes blur the line between nature and the city, adding a new layer to its geometry. The work captures the instant of rain hitting metal, with droplets suspended on transparent threads, freezing their motion and light.</p>

                <p>This work captures the quiet aftermath of rainfall, when droplets remain on a metal surface. Lightweight, rust-free aluminum symbolizes the urban environment, while the UV resin and vegetable oil recreate the texture and clarity of real water. The suspended droplets evoke a sense of stillness, preserving the fleeting beauty of rain before it disappears.</p>

                <p>This ring incorporates elements of light, shadow, and trees. The wooden base is layered with movable, rotatable leaves, with real leaf fragments embedded to simulate the dappled shadows seen under sunlight. Above, a water droplet evokes the atmosphere of a sunshower ‚Äî golden light glistens on the leaves before being suddenly darkened by rain. In the fleeting moment after the rainfall, droplets cling to the leaves, sparkling once more under the returning sunlight.</p>

                <p>Drops Between Fingers marks the beginning of the Water Droplet Series, capturing the sensation of water droplets slipping between fingers and rippling outward, symbolizing the flow of life. The work began with research into various transparent materials to explore ways of representing the form of water. While water itself has no inherent color, it reflects and contains the hues of its surroundings. The droplets on the ring shift dynamically with the wearer's hand movements, offering a tactile and visual experience of water flowing between the fingers.</p>

                <p>Her practice is rooted in painting and extends to printmaking, installation, performance, participatory workshops, and speculative writing. As a mystic and astrologer, Zhang's work is deeply informed by her cross-cultural experiences. Through comparative and intuitive lenses, she explores themes such as mysticism, trauma, mythology, folk healing, the supernatural, science fiction, and gothic literature.</p>
                <p>Her practice focuses on the trauma and subjective experiences of the Other, treating spirituality, irrationality, and perception as ongoing strategies for healing.</p>

                <p>Bei Han is a contemporary gansai (mineral pigment) artist from China. She holds an MFA from the Communication University of China and has completed advanced studies in water-based materials and oil painting at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. She is currently a member of the National Research Program on Mineral Pigment Painting under the Art Development Center of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China.</p>
                <p>Han Bei's practice merges the ancient Eastern medium of mineral pigments with her personal emotional experiences. Her work reflects an analytical exploration of dreams, fantasy, and hallucination, while also expressing a romantic gaze toward the divine essence of nature.</p>
                <p>Through the layering, carving, and sculpting of natural mineral particles, her pigments become not only carriers of color and structure but also channels for emotional expression.</p>

                <p>The artist is 27 years old and has been painting for 16 years. Since childhood, art has been a constant part of her life. Driven by a deep love for creativity, she continues to paint with instinct and persistence. Over time, she developed a habit of "thinking while painting," creating each work with intuitive, spontaneous strokes.</p>
                <p>She works in various styles and is especially skilled in abstract line drawing, watercolor, digital painting, and pencil sketching. Rather than traditional realism, her art focuses on expressing inner emotions through line, color, and composition. Her abstract works explore intuition and feeling, free from the limits of physical reality or logic.</p>
                <p>She often visualizes flowing images in her mind, like fast-changing film scenes, which inspire her work. She has never experienced creative block and easily moves between abstract and figurative styles.</p>
                <p>Through years of practice, she has developed her own visual language‚Äîwhere lines express emotion, color follows intuition, and every piece becomes a direct conversation between artist and medium.</p>

                <p>It was the 188th day of the war. Smoke covered the broken town. Suddenly, a child shouted, "The Bird of Paradise is here!"</p>
                <p>Other children peeked out from behind the ruins, eyes wide with wonder. "The Bird of Paradise is here!" they repeated.</p>
                <p>The magical bird had arrived. Its colorful wings glowed like jewels. Elders once said: if the bird's wings touch you, you'll grow white feathers and fly with it to a peaceful paradise.</p>
                <p>The children watched in awe. The glowing wings gently touched a few of them‚Äîthen, soft white wings appeared on their backs!</p>
                <p>The bird's light grew brighter, and its wings changed shape, forming a glowing time-travel ship. A calm voice spoke in their minds: "Portal ready. Destination: a new peaceful home. Come aboard."</p>
                <p>The chosen children slowly floated into the air, carried by an invisible force. They entered the ship, smiling with joy and excitement.</p>
                <p>The ship vanished silently, leaving behind only a swirl of colored light that quickly disappeared.</p>
                <p>The square became quiet again. The children who stayed behind still looked up at the sky. The wind blew dust through the ruins. They stood like forgotten seeds, waiting.</p>
                <p>Was that door a rescue‚Äîor another goodbye? No one knew. The world kept turning. And the waiting continued.</p>

                <p>Her artistic practice is grounded in the concept of fusion‚Äîunderstood as the blending of cultural identities‚Äîwhich serves as the creative foundation for her work. This idea informs every stage of her process, from initial conception to technical execution.</p>
                <p>Her research takes form through the creation of poetically charged images and objects that reinterpret domestic and cultural themes, aspects of everyday life, and elements of folk art, inviting multiple interpretations from a contemporary lens.
